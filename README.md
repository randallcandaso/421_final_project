# 421_final_project

Instructions: Because the code is contained within two notebook files, the code is easy to run through the use of cells. The datasets used in the project are included on Github as well as the D2L project folder for downloadability. Code requires the datasets to be present within the same folder. The first notebook is final_project_dataset which contains the code for data exploration, pre-processing, and combining of the two original datasets. The second is final_project_model which contains the code for dataset visuals, model creation, and model analysis.
